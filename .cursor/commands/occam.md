# occam

Apply Occam's Razor principle to simplify code: remove unnecessary complexity, eliminate redundant code, and refactor for clarity while maintaining functionality.

## Usage

When you use `/occam`, I will:

1. **Analyze the current code** for unnecessary complexity
2. **Identify redundant patterns** that can be simplified
3. **Suggest or apply simplifications** that maintain functionality
4. **Remove dead code** and unused imports/variables
5. **Consolidate duplicate logic** into reusable functions
6. **Simplify conditional logic** and reduce nesting
7. **Optimize data structures** and algorithms where appropriate

## Principles

- **Simplicity over complexity**: Prefer the simplest solution that works
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication
- **Remove unused code**: Delete dead code, unused imports, and unused variables
- **Clear over clever**: Prefer readable code over clever tricks
- **Maintain functionality**: Never break existing functionality while simplifying

## Examples

- Simplify nested conditionals into early returns
- Extract repeated code into functions
- Remove unused imports and variables
- Consolidate similar functions
- Simplify complex expressions
- Remove unnecessary abstractions
- Optimize data structures

## When to use

Use `/occam` when:
- Code feels overly complex
- You see repeated patterns
- There's dead code to clean up
- You want to improve readability
- Code needs refactoring for maintainability
